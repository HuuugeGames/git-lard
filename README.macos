To build git-lard under macos you need to install the following ports using MacPorts:
- gettext (libintl)
- libiconv
- openssl
- zlib

Make sure you have initialized submodules:
~/git-lard$ git submodule update --init

Execute build command:
~/git-lard/build$ make release

Copy the resulting git-lard to /usr/local/bin or ~/bin (if it's in your $PATH)
as git-fat.
