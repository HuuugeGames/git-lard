To build git-lard under cygwin you need to install the following packages:
- gcc-g++
- libiconv-devel
- libintl-devel
- make
- openssl-devel
- zlib-devel

Make sure you have initialized submodules:
~/git-lard$ git submodule update --init

Execute build command:
~/git-lard/build$ make release

Copy the resulting git-lard.exe to /usr/bin or ~/bin (if it's in your $PATH)
as git-fat.exe.
